;;; Commentary:

;;  Company autocompletion backend for powershell.  It will ask to create an
;;  index of commands when first invoked.  This takes a while, so `company-powershell'
;;  completion will disable itself until the process is finished.
;;
;;  `company-show-location' ("M-.") looks up the online help in the browser
;;  for the completion
;;  candidate if available.

;; Example:

;; ![example](ex/example.png)
