Description:

 Company autocompletion backend for powershell.  It will ask to create an
 index of commands when first invoked.  This takes a while, so `company-powershell`
 completion will disable itself until the process is finished.

 `company-show-location` ("M-.") looks up the online help in the browser
 for the completion
 candidate if available.

Example:
